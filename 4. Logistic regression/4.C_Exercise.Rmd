# **Exercise 1:** 

> 1. Change the weights to different values, and see how your optimal cut-off changes.
> 2. obtain confusion matrix and calculate the (asymmetric) cost based on the optimal cut-off. 
> 3. Find optimal cut-off probability using symmetric cost. 
> 4. Calculate MR and cost, what do you find?
> 5. Further, rewrite the cost function to make the weights (or the ratio of two weights) as input parameter.
> 6. Use F-score to determine the optimal cut-off.

# **Exercise 2:** 

> 1. Calculate MR, FPR, FNR based on the optimal cut-off you get from training sample with weights (5:1)
> 2. Calculate asymetric cost based on the optimal cut-off you get from training sample with weights (5:1)
> 3. Calculate above statistics based on the cut-off you get from training sample with symmetric weights (1:1)
