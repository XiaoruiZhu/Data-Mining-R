Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is usually the first step when you analyze data, because you want to know what information the dataset carries. In this lab, we introudce basic R functions for EDA in both quantitative and graphical approaches. In the end, we will also learn some useful functions for data manipulation, which is often necessary in data analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Basic summary Statistics

Before start, always do 

* set the working directory!
* create a new R script (unless you are continuing last project)
* Save the R script.

Let's first load the **Iris** dataset. This is a very famous dataset in almost all data mining, machine learning courses, and it has been an R build-in dataset. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginicaand Iris versicolor). Four features(variables) were measured from each sample, they are the **length** and the **width** of sepal and petal, in centimeters. It is introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936.

## Explore the *iris* Dataset with R

### Load Data
The *iris* flower data set is included in R. It is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.

First, load iris data to the current workspace
 
```{r}
data(iris)
iris
```

### What is in the dataset?
You can use `head()` or `tail()` to print the first or last few rows of a dataset:
```{r}
head(iris)
```

Check dimensionality, the dataset has 150 rows(observations) and 5 columns (variables)
```{r dim}
dim(iris)
```

Another way to get the dim is to use ncol or nrow:
```{r}
ncol(iris)
nrow(iris)
```


Variable names or column names
```{r varname}
names(iris)
```

You can also use this command
```{r, eval=FALSE}
colnames(iris)
```

Structure of the dataframe, note that the difference between *num* and *Factor*
```{r struc}
str(iris)
```

By default, R treat strings as factors (or categorical variables), in many situations  (for example, building a regression model) this is what you want because R can automatically create "dummy variables" from the factors. However when merging data from different sources this can cause errors. In this case you can use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` option in `read.table`.

```{r}
class(iris[,1])
class(iris[,5])
```


### Simple summary statistics

Try the `summary()` function.
```{r}
summary(iris)
```

It only produces the location statistics for continues variable, and count for categorical variable. How about standard deviation, another important summary statistic?

```{r}
sd(iris$Sepal.Length)
quantile(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

Using `apply()` to calculate a particular statistic for multiple variables at the same time.

```{r}
apply(iris[,1:4], 2, sd)  # "2" means "by column"
```


## Summary by groups

### Use `aggregate()` function to find summary statistics by group.
```{r}
# group mean
aggregate(.~Species, iris, mean) 
# group standard deviation
aggregate(.~Species, iris, sd)
```

What if there are multiple "factor" variables?

Let's first artificially create a new column that categorizes "Sepal.Length" by quantile.
```{r}
# use function cut for categorization based on quntiles
Cate.SepalLength<- cut(iris$Sepal.Length, breaks=quantile(iris$Sepal.Length), include.lowes=T)
# Add the created categorical variable to the data
iris1<- iris
iris1$Sepal.Length.Cate <- Cate.SepalLength
```

Average value of numerical varialbes by two categorical variables: Species and Sepal.Length.Cate:

```{r}
aggregate(.~Species+Sepal.Length.Cate, iris1, mean)
```


### Pivot table
```{r}
# One-way count table
table(iris1$Species)
# Two-way count table
table(iris1$Species, iris1$Sepal.Length.Cate)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
customer <- read.csv(file = "https://xiaoruizhu.github.io/Data-Mining-R/lecture/data/CustomerData.csv")
```

> 4. Obtain the mean of *HHIncome* by *MaritalStatus*
> 5. Obtain a pivot table of *LoanDefault* vs. *JobCategory*. Which Job Category has the highest and lowerst loan default rate?

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

head(customer)
names(customer)
summary(customer)
aggregate(HHIncome~MaritalStatus, data = customer, mean)
mypivot= table(customer$LoanDefault, customer$JobCategory)
mypivot[2,]/table(customer$JobCategory)

## Download the customer data here, and read into R.
customer <- read.csv(file = "https://xiaoruizhu.github.io/Data-Mining-R/lecture/data/CustomerData.csv")

## How many rows and columns of the dataset?
col<-ncol(customer)

## Obtain the summary statistics (Min, Median, Max, Mean and Std.) for Age, 
## EducationYears, HHIncome, and CreditDebt.

# Age
summary(customer$Age)
sd(customer$Age)

# EducationYears
summary(customer$EducationYears)
sd(customer$EducationYears)

# HHIncome

summary(customer$HHIncome)
sd(customer$HHIncome)

# CreditDebt.

## Obtain the mean of HHIncome by MaritalStatus

aggregate(HHIncome~MaritalStatus, customer, mean)

## Obtain a pivot table of LoanDefault vs. JobCategory.
## Which Job Category has the highest and lowerst loan default rate? 

table_loan<-table(customer$JobCategory,customer$LoanDefault)
table_loan
table_loan_pro<-prop.table(table(customer$JobCategory,customer$LoanDefault))
table_loan_pro
cbind(table_loan,table_loan_pro)

# Data Manipulation

## Re-ordering columns and sorting rows
Sorting by one or more variables is a common operation that you can do with datasets. With RStudio version 0.99+, you can sort a dataset when viewing it by clicking column header. 

To do it with code, let's suppose that you would like to find the top 5 rows in `iris` dataset with largest `Sepal.Length`.

```{r}
iris[order(iris$Sepal.Length, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5], ] 
```


## Sorting

Sorting by one or more variables is a common operation that you can do with datasets. With RStudio version 0.99+, you can sort a dataset when viewing it by clicking column header. 

To do it with code, let's suppose that you would like to find the top 5 rows in `iris` dataset with largest `Sepal.Length`.

```{r}
iris[order(iris$Sepal.Length, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5], ] 
```

The syntax is cleaner with the `arrange()` function in the `dplyr` package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(iris, desc(Sepal.Length))[1:5, ]
```

## Select columns

If you want to select one or more variables of a data frame, there are two ways to do that. First is using indexing by "[]". Second is `select()` function in *dplyr*. For example, suppose we want to select variable "Sepal.Length":
```{r eval=FALSE}
iris[, "Sepal.Length"]
```
or alternatively select two variables: "Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"
```{r eval=FALSE}
iris[, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")]
```


## Missing data

### Detect missing values

Recall the customer dataset we in previous exercise.
```{r}
customer <- read.csv("data/CustomerData.csv")
```

```{r}
# How many missing values are in customer dataset?
sum(is.na(customer))
# How many missing values are in each variable?
data.frame(num_missing=colSums(is.na(customer)))
```

### How to deal with missing values?

* Simply delete those observations(rows) that contains missing value.
* Impute missing values by certain statistics, predictions or random number from estimated distributions.

```{r}
# Simply delete rows with missings
clean_customer<- na.omit(customer)
nrow(clean_customer)
# Impute missing values by median
medHS<- median(customer$HouseholdSize, na.rm = T)
customer$HouseholdSize[is.na(customer$HouseholdSize)==T]<- medHS
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
customer <- read.csv(file = "https://xiaoruizhu.github.io/Data-Mining-R/lecture/data/CustomerData.csv")
