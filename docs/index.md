# Data Mining in R

This set of learning materials for undergraduate and graduate data mining class is currently maintained by Xiaorui Zhu(zhuxiaorui1989@gmail.com). Many materials are from Dr. Yan Yu's previous class notes. And lab notes are from four previous Ph.D. students [go to top](#header) in Lindner College of Business. Thanks to Dr. Brittany Green for recording the videos.
