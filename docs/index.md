# Data Mining in R

This set of learning materials for undergraduate and graduate data mining class is currently maintained by Xiaorui Zhu(zhuxiaorui1989@gmail.com). Many materials are from Dr. Yan Yu's previous class notes. And lab notes are from four previous Ph.D. students in Lindner College of Business. Thanks to Dr. Brittany Green for recording the videos.
